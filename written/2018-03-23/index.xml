I&amp;rsquo;ve plotted my pace for 15 official marathons. Its quite obvious now that I&amp;rsquo;ve plateaued at a nominal pace. You can see that I got fast quite quickly - after about three years I hit my plateau of about 8 minutes per mile.
In my first three years of running I ran about 20 miles a week - sometimes more, sometimes less.</description></item><item><title>Average chocolate chip cookies</title><link>/average-cookies/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Mar 2018 20:57:15 -0700</pubDate><guid>/average-cookies/</guid><description>I recently wrote a program to determine consensus recipes. It scrapes the web for a thousand recipes for a given recipe (e.g. cookies), then clusters the recipes and finally computes an average ingredient list for each cluster. This idea was prompted by making brownies, because I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure whether to use cocoa, chocolate, or both. Turns out there is a recipe for each variation of brownie.
I decided to try out my software in the real world.</description></item></channel></rss>
