I was annoyed at having to swipe right on a lot of people who would probably never respond to me after I swiped right. It seemed to me to be a waste of time to swipe through those people who would not actually be available in my dating pool. I&amp;rsquo;d rather only view a pool of people who respond to me so we can open a dialog right away to see whether we would match.</description></item></channel></rss>
