However, it is currently not possible to make captioned images, i.e. make an HTML figure using just Markdown - at least at the current spec (version 0.27) at the time of this writing. Of course, Markdown supports HTML, so you could just write a &amp;ldquo;&amp;lt;figure&amp;gt;&amp;rdquo; tag everywhere instead of writing with the Markdown &amp;ldquo;![]()&amp;rdquo; image syntax.

Not thinking about public opinion enables you too emit thoughts without fear of judgment, which is why I&amp;rsquo;ve found it helpful to use social media without being social.
I make accounts on social media that are totally protected. I don&amp;rsquo;t follow anyone or let anyone follow me. I keep the account locked so no one can even visit it.</description></item><item><title>OSS divisions</title><link>/oss/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Sep 2017 09:04:40 -0600</pubDate><guid>/oss/</guid><description>There are two reasons I think its good for everyone to have a good division between &amp;ldquo;personal&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;corporate&amp;rdquo; use for open-source software (OSS).
If you, the OSS maintainer, are compensated, everyone benefits. While your time spent coding your OSS is valuable, I think the frictionless delivery of new features and bug fixes is something that shouldn&amp;rsquo;t go away. Since I&amp;rsquo;m not actively supporting you financially to work on this, I can only hope that someone does so I can benefit.</description></item></channel></rss>
