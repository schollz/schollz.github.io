To truly make a recipe from scratch you need only a few ingredients: sun, water, soil, and seeds.2 I previously made a website with various recipes that lets you see the work flows for creating different foods from scratch.3 I&amp;rsquo;ve now created another website, recursive.</description></item><item><title>Installing Keybase on Chromebook</title><link>/installing-keybase-on-chromebook/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 May 2018 10:28:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>/installing-keybase-on-chromebook/</guid><description>Keybase is a great system for mounting a end-to-end encrypted filesystem. It also has an encrypted git feature which is great for storing secure information in repositories. While keybase has releases for most systems, that don&amp;rsquo;t have any releases for armh, of which Chromebooks fall.
With help from the keybase developers I have determined a way to get keybase up and running on a Chromebook in no time.
First install the pre-requisites:</description></item><item><title>My Favorite Vimrc</title><link>/my-favorite-vimrc/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 May 2018 10:25:45 -0700</pubDate><guid>/my-favorite-vimrc/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been enjoying writing in vim a lot more. There is a nice and simple way to make writing a lot easier (word-wrapping, nice color scheme). You can just make the following config file (save as ~/.vimrc):

The styling has a lot of inspiration from the blog of Chris Siebenmann which I think excels in simplicity and minimalism. It uses mage for an OS-agnostic build system to make it easy to chain commands. It has a simple search and comments ready-to-go.

This question really is a bunch of questions together. Security that is important is end-to-end encryption and guaranteed that the right recipient(s) receives the file.
Is it fast? This is probably the most important question. Basically the speed will be rate-limited by the network, but a fast file transfer should utilize the network as much as possible.
Is it easy to use (e.g. for an average person and not a CS major)?</description></item><item><title>Shallow `go get`</title><link>/shallow-go-get/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 May 2018 07:00:57 -0700</pubDate><guid>/shallow-go-get/</guid><description>This is a little hack to use shallow clones for new git checkouts with go get. Unfortunately for Gophers, this has been an open issue for three years counting without a workable solution aside from patching the go toolchain yourself. This solution utilizes a git wrapper that determines if a pull/clone is happening and then makes sure it is shallow.
The wrapper is only a few lines of code, here&amp;rsquo;s the main.</description></item></channel></rss>
