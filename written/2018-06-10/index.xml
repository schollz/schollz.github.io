They all do similar things that add on features that aren&amp;rsquo;t implicit in git, like issues and wiki, etc.
Unbeknownst to some, fossil is an alternative to git that actually has built-in issues, wiki, and easily self-hosts. This is a quickstart to get started with hosting and cloning fossil repos. The official quickstart is very good, although I realized a few tricks in getting the fossil hosting to work on HTTPS behind a reverse-proxy and getting fossil to work with Go.</description></item></channel></rss>
