Its pretty easy to feel like the the odd one out in your family. Lots of families might have the one child who is left-handed, or the father who converted to Christianity. Its also easy to feel like the odd one out in your community. You might be known as the math teacher that climbs mountains or the guy that rollerblades without a shirt while playing guitar.</description></item><item><title>Send a file with netcat</title><link>/send-with-netcat/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Oct 2017 04:15:10 -0600</pubDate><guid>/send-with-netcat/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned how to send a file with IPFS and also how to send a file with an assortment of modern techniques. Here&amp;rsquo;s yet another method to send a file. It&amp;rsquo;s only a line of bash, and you can get a nice progress bar and upload to any server that is listening on a certain TCP port.
On the server computer, server.com, that is receiving the file, just do:
netcat -l -p 6000 &amp;gt; somefile On the other computer that is sending the file just do:</description></item><item><title>Look ma, no hard disk</title><link>/just-ram/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Oct 2017 04:51:39 -0600</pubDate><guid>/just-ram/</guid><description>I had a bad habit of leaving everything in my Downloads folder, and never clearing anything out. I might need it, assume, at some point. However, this is never true. To get myself out of this &amp;ldquo;I might need it*&amp;rdquo; mindset, I started deleting my Downloads/ folder every time I start my computer. This way, I had to remember, that anything I put in there would disappear when I turned my computer off.</description></item><item><title>Send a file with IPFS</title><link>/ipfs-transfer/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Oct 2017 21:27:07 -0600</pubDate><guid>/ipfs-transfer/</guid><description>Sending a file with IPFS is fun (after all it is leveraging the peer-to-peer network and content-addressable blocks of data!) and easy.
Install IPFS Here is the basic instructions to install:
wget https://dist.ipfs.io/go-ipfs/v0.4.11/go-ipfs_v0.4.11_linux-amd64.tar.gz tar -xvzf go-ipfs* cd go-ipfs sudo ./install.sh ipfs init ipfs config Addresses.Gateway /ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/9001 ipfs config Addresses.API /ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/5001 The last two lines are useful for listening on LAN connected devices. The port 0.0.0.0 will let run the IPFS daemon on a different computer but still use the peer-to-peer portal from that computer.</description></item><item><title>Most sentences are unique</title><link>/sentences/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Oct 2017 21:16:56 -0600</pubDate><guid>/sentences/</guid><description>How long does a sentence have to be to gaurantee its uniqueness? This question can be answered by looking at a huge corpora of indexed sentences, e.g. the text of the internet. All that has been written on the internet is not nessecarily a million monkeys typing on a keyboard (although a million monkeys typing on a keyboard could produce all the current content),1 with exception of a website that generates random text.</description></item><item><title>Using crawdad</title><link>/crawdad/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Oct 2017 20:03:10 -0600</pubDate><guid>/crawdad/</guid><description>crawdad is a simple, yet powerful alternative for scraping in a distributed, persistent manner (backed by Redis). It can do simple things, like generating site maps. It can also do complicated things, like extracting all the quotes from every page on a quotes website (tutorial follows).
Install First get Docker which will be used for running Redis.
Then you can simply download crawdad:
$ wget https://github.com/schollz/crawdad/releases/download/v3.0.0/crawdad_3.0.0_linux_amd64.zip $ unzip crawdad*zip $ sudo mv crawdad*amd64 /usr/local/bin/crawdad Unlike many other scraping frameworks, crawdad is a single binary that has no dependencies.</description></item></channel></rss>
