Unfortunately, since sarcasm is a close friend to cynicism, this can make the Internet a negative and disillusioning place. I decided to make an effort to make a place on the Internet that is more positive and reflective. This place would be where you can present your own story, anonymously and sincerely. The result was initially called &amp;ldquo;Stories, Incognito&amp;rdquo; but I later decided on the name &amp;ldquo;anonfiction&amp;rdquo; (i.</description></item><item><title>Podcasts I heard</title><link>/podcasts-2017/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Dec 2017 09:41:01 -0600</pubDate><guid>/podcasts-2017/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve spent days sitting in a dark room looking into a microscope. Lots of the time I listen to music, but I&amp;rsquo;ve started to listen to podcasts. I&amp;rsquo;ve found a lot of great podcasts out there. I think my number one category of podcast is ‚Äúthe podcast about the small things.‚Äù Its always a welcome relief from the mainstream media which focuses more on the hyperbole of small things. I do like some news, but I&amp;rsquo;ve found some great podcasts that pitch the news in a more informal and friendly way.</description></item><item><title>Books I read</title><link>/books-2017/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Dec 2017 09:41:01 -0600</pubDate><guid>/books-2017/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve read about 15 books this year - not as many as I&amp;rsquo;d like (I read 40 in college), but I did a lot of magazine reading too (e.g. The Sun and The New Yorker). The books that I read can be classified into three major categories: non-fictional animal encounters, magical horror realism and fictional non-fiction.
The first main category are books I read in 2017 are about non-fictional animal encounters.</description></item><item><title>Painting from computer-generated primitives</title><link>/painting-primitives/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Dec 2017 18:25:57 -0700</pubDate><guid>/painting-primitives/</guid><description>Computers can do many amazing things with art, especially with the advent of neural networks1. In 2016, I saw some computer-generated art that inspired me to generate art as a human. The art I saw was a rendition of photos in primitives. Here&amp;rsquo;s an example (For much more, just follow @primitivepic):
These kinds of photos were generated using a computer program that tries to replicate a photo by slowly building up primitive shapes (ellipses, rectangles, triangles) of a single color until eventually enough different shapes and colors converge on the original image.</description></item><item><title>Odd one out</title><link>/odd-one-out/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Oct 2017 12:01:10 -0600</pubDate><guid>/odd-one-out/</guid><description>Being the &amp;ldquo;odd one out&amp;rdquo; means that you differ from all other people in some way. Its pretty easy to feel like the the odd one out in your family. Lots of families might have the one child who is left-handed, or the father who converted to Christianity. Its also easy to feel like the odd one out in your community. You might be known as the math teacher that climbs mountains or the guy that rollerblades without a shirt while playing guitar.</description></item><item><title>Send a file with netcat</title><link>/send-with-netcat/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Oct 2017 04:15:10 -0600</pubDate><guid>/send-with-netcat/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned how to send a file with IPFS and also how to send a file with an assortment of modern techniques.

Install IPFS Here is the basic instructions to install:
wget https://dist.ipfs.io/go-ipfs/v0.4.11/go-ipfs_v0.4.11_linux-amd64.tar.gz tar -xvzf go-ipfs* cd go-ipfs sudo ./install.sh ipfs init ipfs config Addresses.Gateway /ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/9001 ipfs config Addresses.API /ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/5001 The last two lines are useful for listening on LAN connected devices. The port 0.0.0.0 will let run the IPFS daemon on a different computer but still use the peer-to-peer portal from that computer.</description></item><item><title>Most sentences are unique</title><link>/sentences/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Oct 2017 21:16:56 -0600</pubDate><guid>/sentences/</guid><description>How long does a sentence have to be to gaurantee its uniqueness?

It can do simple things, like generating site maps. It can also do complicated things, like extracting all the quotes from every page on a quotes website (tutorial follows).
Install First get Docker which will be used for running Redis.
Then you can simply download crawdad:
$ wget https://github.com/schollz/crawdad/releases/download/v3.0.0/crawdad_3.0.0_linux_amd64.zip $ unzip crawdad*zip $ sudo mv crawdad*amd64 /usr/local/bin/crawdad Unlike many other scraping frameworks, crawdad is a single binary that has no dependencies.</description></item><item><title>Automatic captioning of images using Javascript</title><link>/captioning-images/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Sep 2017 13:55:03 -0600</pubDate><guid>/captioning-images/</guid><description>I like to caption my images and I like to write in Markdown.

Not thinking about public opinion enables you too emit thoughts without fear of judgment, which is why I&amp;rsquo;ve found it helpful to use social media without being social.
I make accounts on social media that are totally protected. I don&amp;rsquo;t follow anyone or let anyone follow me. I keep the account locked so no one can even visit it.</description></item><item><title>OSS divisions</title><link>/oss/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Sep 2017 09:04:40 -0600</pubDate><guid>/oss/</guid><description>There are two reasons I think its good for everyone to have a good division between &amp;ldquo;personal&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;corporate&amp;rdquo; use for open-source software (OSS).
If you, the OSS maintainer, are compensated, everyone benefits. While your time spent coding your OSS is valuable, I think the frictionless delivery of new features and bug fixes is something that shouldn&amp;rsquo;t go away. Since I&amp;rsquo;m not actively supporting you financially to work on this, I can only hope that someone does so I can benefit.</description></item><item><title>Beware of the free trial</title><link>/beware-of-the-free-trial/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jun 2017 09:51:22 -0600</pubDate><guid>/beware-of-the-free-trial/</guid><description>I was looking at my bank statement last week and something was wrong.

No, I didn&amp;rsquo;t think so. But also, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t remember actually signing up for it.
It got worse.

Is X a X word? Is &amp;ldquo;X&amp;rdquo;, X?

Using Docker, I was able to get 2 blogs run on the smallest DigitalOcean droplet (which was already running two dozen other things). Each blog required 360MB of RAM, and the total Docker space was 3.</description></item></channel></rss>
