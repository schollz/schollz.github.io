I started out by sketching out the painting, loose white paint on red.
The background went very quickly, but I like how it turned out.
I spent most of the time on the head, but I think the light colors came out well.
If you have a picture that you&amp;rsquo;d like me to paint, leave a comment below.</description></item></channel></rss>
