I write programs for myself, to make things easier or just because they are fun to write. Few of these programs are useful3. More often I write useless programs, like a program to determine if random squiggles generate random numbers4. I started painting and coding about fifteen years ago5 for my own enjoyment. Along the way, though I&amp;rsquo;ve found some interesting comparisons about the reception of paintings and programs and whats it like to interact with other hackers and painters.</description></item><item><title>Painting of Red Heifer</title><link>/painting-red-heifer/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Apr 2018 00:16:52 -0700</pubDate><guid>/painting-red-heifer/</guid><description>I started out with this great photo by James Wheeler.
I started out by sketching out the painting, loose white paint on red.
The background went very quickly, but I like how it turned out.
I spent most of the time on the head, but I think the light colors came out well.
If you have a picture that you&amp;rsquo;d like me to paint, leave a comment below.</description></item><item><title>Painting of roof with cats</title><link>/painting-roof/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Mar 2018 00:16:52 -0700</pubDate><guid>/painting-roof/</guid><description>I recently completed my biggest painting ever, 24&amp;rdquo; by 36&amp;rdquo; canvas with acrylic. I started out with a red canvas because I like how it can surround paintings to make them a little bolder (see some of my other paintings with a red background).
I picked out the starting picture - of a lone cat on a tiled roof in Jarandilla de la Vera, Spain. The original picture was taken by Fernando Nieto (check out his 500px, its great!</description></item><item><title>Painting from computer-generated primitives</title><link>/painting-primitives/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Dec 2017 18:25:57 -0700</pubDate><guid>/painting-primitives/</guid><description>Computers can do many amazing things with art, especially with the advent of neural networks1. In 2016, I saw some computer-generated art that inspired me to generate art as a human. The art I saw was a rendition of photos in primitives. Here&amp;rsquo;s an example (For much more, just follow @primitivepic):
These kinds of photos were generated using a computer program that tries to replicate a photo by slowly building up primitive shapes (ellipses, rectangles, triangles) of a single color until eventually enough different shapes and colors converge on the original image.</description></item><item><title>Watercoloring with neural networks</title><link>/watercolor/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jun 2017 05:48:49 -0700</pubDate><guid>/watercolor/</guid><description>Can a neural network help me improve my art? Could I take a photo, paint it, and then use a neural network to render the original photo in the style of my painting to make it better? Could I learn something from it?
Some background I started thinking about these questions because I’ve been reading about neural networks, and I’ve seen a lot of these neural networks create new works of art by rendering a photo in the style of a famous painting1.</description></item></channel></rss>
